# christopher-word-count2 package

A simple Atom package to count the words in a file.

The package makes a count once when it is activated. It displays that count at the top of the screen - unchanging no matter what changes are made to the file. To make a new count the user must toggle the package once to remove the old display and again to display a new count.
